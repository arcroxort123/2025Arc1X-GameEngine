2025Arc1X-GameEngine

This describes a GameEngine capable of running on the Arch1X System and QuantumPillar PacketDelivery or Auto-Brokered-Distribution-Pipeline

Description of GameEngine
A DragonClaw.  
MainPiece: Threepronged integrated bulkhead-structure with a subClaw for supporting an internal component. This resonances of is charged by electromagnetic forces to transfer to the component it holds. (This can be a singular piece or multi-tiered-piece dpeending on its design)
Additional Component: A ballistix Coiled cylinder with a contained rod/bead which is clamped by the DragonClaw, and is charged by electromagnetic forces. The coiled cylinder may be copper, and is induced to accelerate the bead/rod within its corridor. (this may or may not be loaded with ballistics/rods that are funneled through the cylinder, but is typically used to bounce a mobile munition within to generate power.)
This is secured a a full module, which is charged via a battery, it may be self charging through its usage also generating charge to a battery, as the cylinder is connected to a battery. (The cylinder is then wired on each end to a battery, and the battery is then wired to the bulkhead)

The purpose of this model is to generate a flux of data/powerdraw for which is optimized once sustained in its electric-magnetic and electrical-conversion of any power source, including itself.
The power systems are then measured and their data correalated for brokering (for what ever reason, to simulate a gamespace in which the power has conducted itself as a conduit to be measured)

The typical Settings are Standard/Optimized/Economic
With A Charge/Run/Extended-Run of its original powerdraw. or (Charge/WindUp/Cooldown)
StandardSample Charge/Run/Extended-Run may look like:
15Minutes/10Minutes/5Minutes
An OptimizedSample Charge/Run/Extended-Run may look like:
15Minutes/10Minutes/8Minutes
In which it has cycled its own powerdraw being sutained by battery or direct-powerflow to have been optimized in its WindUp/Cooldowns having increased runtime overall.

For every Cycle of the Standard-Setting, it may aquire half a Cycle to which it may Chamber for later use.
for every Cycle of the Optimized-Setting, it may aquire half a Cycle OR MORE to which it may Chamber for later use.

This is largely dependent on powerdraw and other factors but the idea is to reserve/surplus a diminished quantity of the original powerdraws invested. (So for every Battery, some portion of that battery may be reserved overall after every cycle)
It also suggests, that the amount of reserve/backup of power stored, may effect current runtimes to a diminished quantity of their original capacities. So--for Economical Settings.
it may appear that a Charge/WindUp/Cooldown may have larger demands/diminished durations in which a small portion of its original powerdraw may be stored, that it may aquire HALF a CYCLE or MORE to which it may Chamber for later use. (At higher costs/lowered runtimes of the original battery, but storing more than either the Standard/Optimized Settings)

These settings are calibrated and correalated to their test-runs, to also generate a power-algoritm, in which a gamespace may be "designed" due to the readouts/metrics that may be brokered of their PowerDraws/battery-use. or Shared/Hybrid Runtimes between settings and so on, per cycles invested.
In a way, this associates/affiliates itself to a Refinment/DataScrape involving Powerdraws, and can be used to "field test" certain Game-Engine Surfaces/System Modules for which may be more desirable/priotized over others depending on their "SpecialCases/Adaptive Frameworks involved".
This summuraizes the SimpleDragonClaw-Framework/Architecture module/device for GameEngine TestRuns.
