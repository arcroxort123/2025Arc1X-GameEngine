This collaborates with the mainfile to recieve/transfer data as encoded/transcoded.
That it will act as any surface data taken from the mainfile
And transcribe to a compile of that data into a file using the QuantumPillar Sources.
It basically is the broker/mediator/numerator/infiltrator or any other form of emulator/module that performs survey/readout/interrogation/deciphering of block/chain data into a filetype.

The filetype is then relayed between the mainfile-device and the quantumpillar or System and Surface.
In development it uses the environment to achieve Surface to Surface commit/collaboration. And can 'polygraph' an encode as necessary to a specific coordination of its intended broadcast/transfer.
