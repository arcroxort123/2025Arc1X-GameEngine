I would like to touch upon the basic/essentials of the overall system.

0) Legacy
We started out creating a Nuclear-Powered Reactor and Turbine-Battery System for easy portable power structures.
This included networking a server/computer station that accesses/handles all of the power from its own screen.
It also comes with a minimap, remote-drone, broadcast-tower, internet, security, trafficking
As well as robotics-factory, chemical factory, and launchbase (for colonization and sustained-habitats)
---
This is a quality of life/ease of access system to automate/optimize the essential needs of a functioning civilization.
It offers protections and improvements to the demands of all jobs/resourcing involved in maintaining a "colony".

--That in itself was a robotic venture, in which machines and jobs were used to fufill the needs of a well-kept population and marketplace. Using Remote-Ai-Assisted Drones and FLAGSHIPS/DECKLANES for easy docking/parking of clients/contracts.

It typically uses Flight-Drones etc.

1) TextBuilds
We upgrade the system later to incorporate virtual 2d-gaming and quantum-science. Using voxels.
This is called the text build, it develops the ai and engines to optimize for power efficiency/productivity and data-rates. It allows for accelerated-data and multiple stacks for reinforced safety protocols and pop-count.

It typically uses Space-Navigating-Drones

2) AdvancedBuilds
The next upgrade concerns converting voxels into quantum-data referred to as quebits. This also adjusts some programming to involve warpdrives/portals with quantum-teleportation.

This allows for Long-Range-Space-Navigation using Warp/Portal Capable-exoDrones

3) MetaBuilds
We expound on utilizing the system with its previous/latest versions for an optimized sequence of data-processing/language-building in AI to incorporate Simulated Dreamspaces.

This insures/assures a AI-ASSISTED DRONE-System can function in some form of auto-pilot over remote-distances including space-ranges.

4) Sandbox
We develop EXPANSIONS and RemotePartitions to host and comply with ai-cryptography and automated-robotics in personalized projects and user-immersions with dreamspace-technology in order to test their compatibility with the system and quantum-level-ai languages/security-threats.

This attempts to automate the entire process of colonization through ai-training in order to establish return/response/rescue/escort missions (in quantum-space or dead-zones).

5) ARC1X-ENVIRONMENT
We develop the Metabuilds/Sandbox to be automated in allowing users to customize/redesign their own proficiency/work-demands as needed for their own projects/dream-builds. As well as portable-hologram-technology.

This enhances the rehabilitive-efforts/affordances of the server system to rescue data that is corrupt or vulnerable. As well as other important high-tech things, it helps users in critical/intensive predicaments. Often Times from 'Scratch'

6) Symbiotic-Arc1x-Game-Engine
Is a collaboration of AI-MODELS and WORLD-BUILDING under QUANTUM-BROKERAGE and AUTOMATED-DATA-EXCHANGE

This finally gets to the point of having a fully-functioning planned-out AI-TRAINING-Program and Ai-Assisted-Service/Gaming-Immersion.

Author's Note: Thank you for considering the applications of the project and I appreciate all the support.
