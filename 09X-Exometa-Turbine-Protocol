09X-Exometa-Turbine-Protocol

Author's Note: I didnt think things would take this far to be honest.

This is a protocol for generating exometa-data within a meta-image.
It changes the meta-image yet again into a hyper-state.
This state takes a form of a counter-paradigm which is considered heavy defcon/severity to the system.
It is basically an exometa-bullion that is also a living image, and that image is similar to RAMIEL (from evangelion, of all things)
