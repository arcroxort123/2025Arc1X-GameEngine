This is a designated casework or openspace in source.
It is designed to be used as a capture/image station in which a contained quarters is monitored.
There may be specific details under which monitoring takes place or is scheduled.
There may be an experimental containment in which monitoring is allowed sampled data.
---It is more or less an experimental observation chamber that is secured by a centralized data-feed/image-feed or monitor, known as a brownie box.
The brownie box is used to observe internalized data in a chamber, often in an array of additional monitors for security reasons.
This forms a QuantumBrownBox Network in which all observations are relayed/conveyed in an experimental version to its containment.
It is designed to trace/track anamolous activity/effects upon its envirnment that are predicted/hypothesized to occur under variable conditions.
It may include an occupant/sample or specimin in which may be encouraged to provide/report upon additional conditions/circumstances such as a psyche-eval/asylum/ward/training experience may entail.
It is considered an anamolous-activity or test-site for experiments involving anamolous-activity or potentitial threat assessment under experimentation. Regarding the environment or occupant/or a target/anamoous condition or phenonmenon.
