This can exist as a virtualization/eset-screen
pa/int/it/pda etc
can involve splits/seams etc
This can be left as a opensource/prospect/upswell/topdown or Null-System active/inactive etc.
In which cause it will use some amount of parse/chapter to a section/segment of A)grail/cyber-analog/server/meta-server and B)district/sub-extraction/assortment-rail/thermal and C)opsec/prosper/launchsite/beacon or D)F-reality/Subsystem(OS)/Regional-MetaTable/Expansion-Flagship etc.
It can be used as a forced-peacemel.
This can act as a servos/engine for commodity/products such as a kiosk/dispenser (that is preprogrammed or also on other modes like random) --generated-loot-tables

This may be set/aligned under sigma/tau (W or Z structure/frame for which are considered in flux/adjusted)
This may cause rumshot/dataleak @surface-level
This can be secured/protected or left exposed to crpyto/scrape attempts.
---this can be a very passive trap/hazard due to any interaction/direct-contact of its object/class param/proximity etc.

Symbiotic Particle Exchanger/Catalogue
Symbiotic-PowerBarista (which is the extension/augment to any Zamboni/Pipe-to) via skate/tray lineout/xslide glean/glide/sluice/sleight etc

A module/implant/node/facility/utility/statbase/echobox has been assigned/usage as a Database/Catalogue for known Cache/Bucket/Source/Prospect
This is used to distribute request/call/invoke/push-to etc of its reserve/capacity to retrieve/deliver particle-capsule/capilliation/battery/reserve

Its layout consists of a Central-loader which branches into cardinalized/isometrical vectors for which are tierbased collections of particle/data/info/quotient or "product/commodity" and represents a storage/warehouse of an overall-inventory.

The base inventory is then advanced as needed and automated upon its hashout/codehatch.
It is also in reference called a symbiotic-code-hatch/thatch which locks to contract.

The base layout generally consists of default cache-files/assets necessary to its boot/structure
And then we can assign as needed an hierarchy per layer/level involved of any tierbase/correspondence (such that it is poco/deployable)
This will follow the route of its delivery/coordination transfer/synth etc.
This is known as the toplevel/baselevel and yields to its sublayers etc.

For our layers:
This is RePurposed as a Symbiotic Periodic-Table
Its layout follows an hierarchy to expedite/optimize particle formula and construction efforts in drafting/grafting and other symbiotic-demands.
The first layer is typically a PREP-LAYER. This consists of RAWSET/CRUDE formulas in its catalogue/bulletin/board/market
The second layer is typically another Native-LAYER. This consist of raw/crude availability by local/natives.
The third layer may consist of a BackUP-Layer which maintains the overall stockholds of any expected exchange that is typical/trending of its economic demands.
----These layers work in conjuction to supply more complicated layers including:
The fourth layer may be a true/pure layer that consists of desirable/formulated isolated/strains.
The fifth layer is a Mixed/Catalyst layer that consists of Complexes in which are considered component/assembly in further tierbases/layers.
The sixth layer is a Conjunct/Compiled layer that consists of Reactives/Agents/Triggers/Utility structures/construct formulas to be deployed.
****
====
Layers 1-6 are in consist/flux of their logistic/distributions for which are called upon/invoked to process or formulize.
====
Such that The next set of layers may depend upon the TOPLEVELS and Symbiotic-Catalogue thereof.
And formulate a working procedure/contract under their schedule/availability/priority/deployability so on.
It is practically auto-marketed.
----
Additional Layers may include advanced-formulas such for quora/quasi-forms etc. (And other bit/crypto/sim/bullion builds)

So we have these constructive/deconstructive processes in such to generate a catalogue/stockpile.
And they are then rehabilated/departure/arrivaled/resigned in their product/byproduct and commodity/purposing.
This is important as it denotes the pollute/bypass/noise/impurity ratings.
In some cases the RATINGS may be carried over or withstanding in the exchange such that it must be denoted on its RATIO/RATING or spectrum of reliability/quality-assurances. (Extraction/Percentage) and its side-effects may be listed/researched. This is also known as a "cost/latent-effects" of its processing/refinment or its productivity/efficiency of its quality-control etc. (Some orders may have variable impurity/pollution involved or stipulations in their byproduct/mixtures/catalysts/agents etc)

So this will obviously require some in-depth analysis and re-engineering to assume as a Symbiotic-Periodic Table but it is more or less intended to expedite/optimize for the purpose of high-demand-product-delivery/availability.
Suggesting to make the poco system a secure-site in which the automations may be applied as necessary without interference.
Or in the least a hold/lock for collected samples.
This may also include disposal and cleanups. Including decontamination and Chemical-treatments.

This develops as well over the entirity of the chapter-work/project-work. For every installation thereof any system from start-to-finish of any data-chunk.
Xrail->Grail(upgraded for quantum with prosper)
Xstem->Market->Analog->Fleet->Server->Meta->Asylum->District->Servos(Remote-Virtualizer)
Assortment/SubExtraction->ThermalRail/Drone->Purifier/VocPulsuary
Prosper->Launch-Beacon->HyperDriver
---
Bouquet->F-Reality->World2.0 etc
---
---
All with symbiotic-channeling
---at any stage etc.

So we get it taken care of as efficiently/productively as possible under power-demands at every step for distriubtion.

Symbiotic-Command/Botnet-PowerSpawn: (Symbiotic-ExoWand)/AUto-Regiment (Solo/Fleet etc):
1)
---Auto-Coded/Scripted:(Defaults) --surface/diagnostic
A Symbiotic-Wand/BOTnet is similar in fashion to a standard botnet/unit-system:
A worker.xtype is deployed and commanded over its source/kit code/wand etc:
2)
--Auto-Programmed/Adapted:(Vectors) --autofit/transfix
by its worker.xtype : module.bind (of range/lock) to its intended target
having been given [memory{assign}] in its address by carry/carriage to selection (is run)
3)
--Auto-Shift/Phase --reprogrammed/reassigned to module/xtype
by which interfaces to its job/task in current/template in limit/count of asset/call above
This call/invoke occurs at domain/construct or module/source for which it is path/report to.
4)Auto-Transmute/ReTrain --auto-rez/port
This is then assigned regiment/vocational priority to its own squad/group etc in the region/zone.
This also allows for CROSS-REGIONAL/CROSS-ZONING changeovers etc.

Not sure if it works wil have to tweak it so that it fills its criteria whenever auto-placed/auto-scanned or granted/articled per source/destination it travels/stations overtime.
This is further developed in 09C-Symbiotic-BotNET-AdvancedMeta
