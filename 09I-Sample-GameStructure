This doesn't include pets/faeries or anything secondary to the main structure such as Concerts/Racing MiniGames etc.

WORKING WITH THE VAULT-LOCKER SYSTEM and the PROMPT-MANIFEST SYSTEMS: We can allow for a reinforced game-structure in sampling such as to develop under secure-workspace/secure-project within safe-measure etc:
Nuetrino-Bomb-Array-Leviathan-Iron-Dome
Causation/(retroactivity) or otherwise in half-life under a Sustainment of particle/diffusion etc (Quasi-Annihilation) within Chambered/Secure-Boilerplate of Infinite-Matrice-Support and Gambit/Simbit Overhauls for which Approximate within System-Capacity and Threshold/Marginal Release/Exhaust of its Fortified-echelon and AUTO-SACREMENT/AUTO-BALANCE of (magnitude/plumb or annihilate-focality) for which assumes GATE-EVENT/TEMPORAL-FIELD with Quasi-Symbiosis. (Auto-Transmute of Commodity in Brokered-Exchange) througyh (micro-excitation of nuclear forces/nuetrino-anti-grab)
This is a self-sustained BLACKBOX EXCHANGE in conduct of Several Modachi/Phoeboe Orbital/Arbitration and Telemetry in a closed-network to conduct-under and against SECURE-VAULT and DDAY (causation/annihilation of aether/vapor or other meta-data integration) --within a safe measure of expectation (its vector and node under infinite-zero-sum etc or immediate eval thereof any boundary/parameter to which is singularity of its blackbox/blacksite)
Safe-Shadow-Stalk-Capability and Syndrome-Syntax-Selection of which is transmit/transfix of target/object in possession/follow-of and may forward/broker by means of relay/convey approval.

Pilot-Seat-Gaming-Mode
This requires that certain effects are in order and organized in such a priority as to initialize a status/acquired enhancement of what is considered the gaming-experience.
Such that
The structure is as follows that users have immersed themselves in a gameplay involving at base layers to their most refined and finalized presentations being up to:

1)"The User-Interface" and all its Integrations, which is basically skill-level and proficiency of their profiles. (The game interface/hub)
2)"The World" and Device integrations which is machine/device usage/capability. (usually a fixated specification of the game's processing and is generable to weather-conditions/metrics etc of the client/game user/server-systems)
3)"The Server" Resourcing and all its service intergrations (which involve the user/player and any experiences that may have conducted within the resources of the game's processes/services)
4"The Assets" and "Gameplay" which may include visualiations and animations etc being used in a stylized format of any interactivity involved. This includes texture and images and models etc. (Everything to make the game/hub textured/visualized)
---
5)"The Brokerage" Combat/Interactions between Content/Logics which are referenced by character/npc or item/event profiles etc (this is the service-requests and combat data taking place etc and goes by very quickly)
6)"The Re-hash" Internalized-Adaptative-Policy and Data-Injection that track brokerage values and world events between character interactions etc. (With combat and item generation etc) --this can include recycled or permuted data-chains of the overall user-experience which are selectived to adjust usermetrics and so on during "encounters/procs etc" --these are generally sourced from logs or world snapshots
7)"The Triptography" is the specific rehashed/reevauluated templates/data-charts invovled from injected/interalized or live-action assessments within the world (which can effect gameplay/experiences such as combat/procs etc)

Another addition to the Game-Structure is a sample-prompt:
Based off the project assets create a glob-world that runs panic-glob using weird-jumper mechanics and timeshifts, there are crypto-entities such as xslime that eat tall-grass-poles and xuelthryn slinkycats that scratch pokey-trees which makes the world more interactable and safer to handle or reposition the user with, the user can also jump into slimes that are moving and move with them and use them to their advantage in platforming. there are pharmacules that can be collected and combined and used as structures or advancements in utility or allow for professionalized access to areas requiring expertise or strategy


FINALLY in Conjunction with the Consolidated-Server and Engine-Development being fully integrated we can assess and broker for automatic/potential soft-lofts/sequence-breaks within world-immersions (under a predictive and expected resolution/outcome) for which is considered manageable and protected in the user-immersion and progressional-release or patching thereof.
