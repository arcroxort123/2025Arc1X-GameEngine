This is a specialized module/chiplet to be used as an exometa-processor for virtualized/digitalized subsystems. In which correspond to virtual-machine supported-images.

This is based on the legacy/setup version for which is standardized as a CPU/NPU for which is based in this way:

A compute is made and recieved
LOGIC-over a logic-core. Singular usage it being a pllcx.
PHASE-The logic-core is PHASE as to allot for all logic sets. In which most logic-configurations are availible.
MODE-The sets are given modes such that each logic-core can be substituted/benched of its configuration. This allows for priority-access/entry throughpass/passthrough of a logic-core.
PERMUTE-And the MODE is PERMUTE allowing for fast distribution of the desirable priority and assumed delivery.
STACK-The permute is designated and delivered as intended in a stack-arrangement to the intended compute as recieved/presented.
---
CODESTATE-This is ai-assisted in its build and form here is adaptive to the cache/bucket thereof which is extended of the channel/transfer in rate/exchange. It can be "composed/isolated" to the cache/bucket virtual/digitalized state from its designed/featured Stack.
PLLCX/IMAGE -The codestate is now derived from the input as yield and reformed under protocol being indicative of its virtual/digital Image for which is adjusted to its designed/featured Stack. --it has been enhanced with encodes/protocols and is rolled-back to a default as IMAGE.
---
The Chiplet now has encoded/protocols variable images of its original/pathway selections/images. This is compliant to exometa-architecture for which is continued and engineered as designated/delivered to be recieved/presented in distribution/composition to which it is adaptive/isolated of.
If the permute/stack fails it may be rebuilt in rollover. (Idk)---doesnt really matter. It's ai-assisted anyway.
