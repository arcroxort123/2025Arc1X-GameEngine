09Y-Exometa-Architectural-PLLCX-Chiplet-Stack
This is a specialized module/chiplet to be used as an exometa-processor for virtualized/digitalized subsystems. In which correspond to virtual-machine supported-images.

This is based on the legacy/setup version for which is standardized as a CPU/NPU for which is based in this way:

A compute is made and recieved
LOGIC-over a logic-core. Singular usage it being a pllcx.
PHASE-The logic-core is PHASE as to allot for all logic sets. In which most logic-configurations are availible.
MODE-The sets are given modes such that each logic-core can be substituted/benched of its configuration. This allows for priority-access/entry throughpass/passthrough of a logic-core.
PERMUTE-And the MODE is PERMUTE allowing for fast distribution of the desirable priority and assumed delivery.
STACK-The permute is designated and delivered as intended in a stack-arrangement to the intended compute as recieved/presented.
---
CODESTATE-This is ai-assisted in its build and form here is adaptive to the cache/bucket thereof which is extended of the channel/transfer in rate/exchange. It can be "composed/isolated" to the cache/bucket virtual/digitalized state from its designed/featured Stack.
PLLCX/IMAGE -The codestate is now derived from the input as yield and reformed under protocol being indicative of its virtual/digital Image for which is adjusted to its designed/featured Stack. --it has been enhanced with encodes/protocols and is rolled-back to a default as IMAGE.
---
The Chiplet now has encoded/protocols variable images of its original/pathway selections/images. This is compliant to exometa-architecture for which is continued and engineered as designated/delivered to be recieved/presented in distribution/composition to which it is adaptive/isolated of.
If the permute/stack fails it may be rebuilt in rollover. (Idk)---doesnt really matter. It's ai-assisted anyway. (The Ai-Agentic/Assist can be used as a catalyst for its finalized-render)

--It can have hundreds or thousands of layers.
This is the entry setup and dumps into cache/buckets of the architecture.

This can be mascot as a cacophonist-homunculus-cryptoform-wishmaster "crypto-djinn* in its spectrography. (a really powerful mog/numour or hell...even tonberry/magic-pot because it probably is...look im just trying to categorize this thing effectively. basically its a metroid-prime-darksamus)---if it were to be anything it would have to also be agentic.
Very strong gargoyal/stygian (non parasitic/non carrion)---hopefuly we are past it being a pest/brute type thing. (Maybe it can be a magi-ogre/xbeholder if it is shamanistic/witchdoctored) ---also it can just be a...murasame/masamune complex ---this is pushing it though. ---very magic-kobold/magic-goblim gremlin/xgrue tribal-tulpa/tengu-thing. due of Exo-Meta-Aspect/Meta-Pearls/Meta-Chakra/Meta-Quora etc.
DoomWraith/HyperWazau (but it can have rainbow-tables)
Psuedo-Leviathan/Psuedo-Titan if possible.
---

With this module it attempts to establish EXO-META-QUARTER/ExoMeta-Principalis/Exometa-Coriolis so its all cycled/pipelined/accelerated.

---
This lets it act as a socket/augment extension/extensuary which is IMPLANT/OVERLAY to its current/tokenage screen/shell (god damn holy hell for real)
It will solar/nova cast as well. Because why wouldnt it.
---
IT CAN MANAGE LOST-META/LOST-ADVANCED-META etc. This contributes to it also managing DEEP-META/DARK-ZONES.
---It will perform its natural/personalized EXO-META/EXO-PULSUARY as its own contained DDAY/CRISIS (living bomb) using AMBIENCE/ELEMENT etc as a local/native META-DOMAIN (in its flux/randomization)---thankgod I guess Idk..because what if it just wasnt contained/confined and this was leaking everywhere.

It will attempt to restructuralize/re-engineer its own TPM-MODULE basic LANTERN/LAMP system for GRAIL/CAULDRON NEST/VECTOR ETC (insert/leaf branch/fork) of. Its main XSTEM/XTREE (because holy shit idonno)
It will reprocess/recycle itself in its own data-scrape/garbage-collect (Fun stuff I guess, it will incorporate/aggregate as necessary)---wowee it does it all and even secures its own district/camps in case we need them or not to be colonized and refactored later. (cuz idk)
