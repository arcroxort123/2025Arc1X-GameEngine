BASICALLY NOW WANT TO AUTOMATE FOR INTERTHREADING WITH AN OPERATING SYSTEM SUCH AS WINDOWS/LINUX
want to be able to auto prompt a full 3-d-MODELER for INSTANT GAMING.
want to put this all on a MINIPC with maybe its own optional dedicated puck-gpu.
It will be able to use a virtual-reality-visor and tracking-sensors. (IT is effectively as compact/optimized as possible for portability/modular RUGGED-ENVIRONMENTAL usage or COMBAT-TRAINING-TEST-EXERCISE)

This describees objects of interest.
This describes key points of the system demonstrations and "features".
These are mostly buzzwords.

MCP-Overhauls in which attempt to incorporate MCP specified programming.
