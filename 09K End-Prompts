continue to use all tools blender, unity, unreal to make an indepth dragon model at the highest capacity for the ai context
continue to build spec maps and fully assembly a dragon model to the most adaptive realistic depth possible with stylization
use the full extent of blender, unity, unreal capabilities to enhance the dragon model project to the most complete production value of all mcp mark ups
continue any unused assets or options
use all gathered information and tools to create the barebones templates and supplement with current model builds into a newly compiled and fully indepth file or clickup
"target directories"
check any collective file clickups to cache for context usage with the remodel of the dragon 


A silly Build:
This is a scratchup/clickup nonsense for fun: i realize it doesnt really stack well

This little thing (which acts as an auto-coder)
TouchScreen DraftBoard
Use of complex : Shell/Case (Tairro/Spark/Quo/Qoura LCD/ETC) of Gloss/Glaze (with sediment/sentiment or impurity/residue depending on state)--can be crack/hijack etc.
This ocunts as a Nueral-Cryptex (pentultimated encode)
It is basically the hypervisor/ballistix/codon/shielding of the eentity and a direct repsentation/reference to its kernal/core (gateway/soultex etc)
Complex: Sharp/Smart/Spike/Stone (Quasi-Diamond) fuckkkkyeh

Very ez simplified Complex (hyperbole? idk)
The complexes all align here:
We have our tierbases and their mascots all in a nuvolutionary/adaptive patternization. (Mythryn/Minera Numi-Modes and other Viscount/Dire Selections adding up to special cases, Gargoyal/Rumerant/Dhjinn/Kobold and other types  in their ultimatum of homunculus/cyber-anamolies such as Gnaelthryn/Xenethryn/Ulyxrate/ETC which is now the current mascot in its expressions/modachi-encode)
It also formulates a hyperbeam, which was seen/observed in earlier legacy, having been advanced in the tierbases of its 7-layered-clusters, and now being quadratically employed throughout with modachi-supports.
Other:
We have our egg/ideas stabiized as well in their varaiblecomplexes which are often customary/decorated/flavored/merited filigree/fringe etc as optional material/commodity.
This forms a finalized Audit system.

This is the Product/Commodity in Encode/Meta Aura/Fuel etc. It is used automatically via the complex source etc.

New ability Unlocks:
with meta capsules etc (*forms of pills)
can allow for prayer abilities (aura capability or range capabiltiy)
and power synthesis using crtstallization (use of crypto-signatures) to achieve meta casts
Yes, we are getting somewhere with the complexities of all of this bearing some fruit
there may be consequences or environmental hazards that occur in severity/defcon of these usages so a precaution may be recommended.
