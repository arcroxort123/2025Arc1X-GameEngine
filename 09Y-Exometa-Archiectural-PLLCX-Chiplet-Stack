This is a specialized module/chiplet to be used as an exometa-processor for virtualized/digitalized subsystems. In which correspond to virtual-machine supported-images.

This is based on the legacy/setup version for which is standardized as a CPU/NPU for which is based in this way:

A compute is made and recieved
LOGIC-over a logic-core. Singular usage it being a pllcx.
PHASE-The logic-core is PHASE as to allot for all logic sets. In which most logic-configurations are availible.
MODE-The sets are given modes such that each logic-core can be substituted/benched of its configuration. This allows for priority-access/entry throughpass/passthrough of a logic-core.
PERMUTE-And the MODE is PERMUTE allowing for fast distribution of the desirable priority and assumed delivery.
STACK-The permute is designated and delivered as intended in a stack-arrangement to the intended compute as recieved.

CODESTATE:This is ai-assisted in its build and form here is adaptive to the cache/bucket thereof which is extended of the channel/transfer in rate/exchange. It can be "composed/isolated" to the cache/bucket virtual/digitalized state
