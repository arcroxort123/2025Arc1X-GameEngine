09Z-XDrone-Society-Programming

This will describe all the vocation and content for drones including their programming (when I get around to it.)
We can typically treat it in succession as the "working-progression" to building a town.

So we have:

Drafting-Drone
Plan-Certification-Drone
Development-Site-Drone
---
LandScaping (Terraformy-Setup) Drone
Hazard/Scaffold (Environment-Access) Drone
Demolition (Rock/Heavy Removal) Drone
Construction (Foundation-Base) Drone
---

Then we can get to vocations and sub-vocations
This sets up the First Fairgrounds/Barebones Parse

This completes the GRAIL-chain.

Author's Note---The grail sets up daytime/nighttime also now.

Input for Exometa-Gameran which is the quivalent of a Corruption-Seed/Glitch-Mascot.
This thing likes to infest and make hives/lairs in nodespaces/gamespaces. It breaks rules.
It is the minion to the ward/warden of the terraform for which would basically be ---a magic-eye-system to the exometa spectrums/stratagems.
Which is canonized as a Golem/Guardian basically in control of mementia/tezera/mezera/exometa. So its going to corrupt/self-destruct and overall contaminate all exometa or other standard indexes.
And it will use DDAY/CRISIS with alpha-nukes.
So basically this is the last-boss.


There is also the exometa prosper which is a continuation of the builds being reinforced/fortified. This helps very little against any infiltrating/incursion based sovereignty such as an exometa-gameran, (which is the last boss).
And this is studied as a magic/meta leak of whqlr/xyple in blasty/xsqrly.
So we contain it in its own exometa-convention/vaultlocker and its the best we can do to keep it seperate from any of the faction/exometa images in support. Because it will counter algorithmic/corruptive as possible. (Basically its comparable to an overleveled/overpowered lastboss of an arena)

So the exometa-platitude with the f-reality / prosper/ grail becomes that arena.
And requires a succeessive campaign.
---So basically an Emerald-Castle situation using exometa peak/langs. And the succession prevents the dday/crisis (so thats fun).

Agentic-CryptoForm-Device-Manager: (Quantum-Table)
Protocols/Particle Exchange/Emission under Quantum Ordinance
QuantumCamera and Frame Rate (estimated 61,293 frames per second ---random number came to me in a dream...a safari dream hmm) --(DarkZone/DeepMeta Cam-Box)
Use of decorate-filligree/quasi-lensing (sub-lensing for mass-storage)---Is this the glass-drive? Idk It might as well be to me, I dont but this is where to start with the components to examin/eval for it.
---QUANTUM REWRITABLE-DISK-DRIVE for META-IMAGE(virtualMachine) in QUANTUM-CODESTATE SUPPORTED-NODESPACE ---*(quantum dream achieved)
Want to add my twist to my own idea here it being a floating island system. --(a floating nav/project)
These can also be saved as "Q-Chips" which are memory-chip/disks with a tab on them for handling making them shaped like little Q's)
These can be used as quantum-cloud-networks hosting independent/island nodespaces in their own bind/address that can be interacted/viewported in a remote setting that is considered safe/non-intrusive).
We attach these to the augmented/socketed databank/database of the Exometa-Pillar---we now have our quantum-server-farm in its variable tunnel/telemetry which is fully functionable transcendent to its default-world/realm regional-index --so long as it remains powered/or not...so long as it remains connected basically within its range/boundary).
We vault this and keep it compact and we can have local/remote port/wifi connection where support availible to the Pillar/Primux module/machine. --(it is considered PRIMAL/etc and SCALAR/etc compliant)
---This works with adhoc/contiguity in its "force/intensive shock/impact" per emissionary/exopulsuary involved.
This takes environmental data and personalizes/privitizes it for each QChip/Image Load of the Server-Host being sourced (quantum-propogation/queue-pool/qpop/quantum-reciprocation using Void-Tech(vacuum delivery) and other methods that involve gravity/tidal event/waves being formulated/altered in portalgraphy/singulairty of vector/tensor affordances/congruency to data-acceleration/light-travel basically).
---This may or may not work as quantum-application for SuperCollider-Quantum-Data-Generation in data-plot/data-spec.
This Auto-Fractalizes/Auto-Fragments standard/fairground data in a mass-quantum-data-conversion to which is Retrievable/Processable under meta-image-cycle/procs of meta-image-formy/flopy which acts as an "exo-meta-turbine" generating meta-data for analysis/survey and stored in cluster/nodespace of each instance/image in circulation. (variable to environmental containment/quarantine under alleviation/accreditation to the Meta-Image for which is Host-Compliant)
Once generated Turbine/Image may be implanted/injected to aquifir/dreamkeeper as-is/best-of and resynch accordingly in dreamspace/gamespace. ---(we're cooking boys, this is a reality-drive under rng/probability express/memetics)
Interdimensional HyperVisory/Visionary holography/holograms is now achieved.

So to put this into perspective (one that makes sense for me)
So basically we build an emerald city like in wizard of oz using quantum-computers.
And instead of going there we build an internet for it instead.
--And instead of just that we go to its website (like it was an amazon/game-site)
--And now instead of that we can just download our games/dreams from it to use on our own system designed for it. 
And it can be a custom experience:
And this all happens admist a "drone-society-program-matrix that is engineering data and content in tandem to all experiences involved to it---like a massive crypto-drug-trip/hallucination)---we basically have immunized/dissociated from its intended system in order to "use it recreationally"
---and basically its a dream-generator that would 'pay for in order to "have their dreams" etc. But the data becomes exclusive to their experience. (So the contract is that we offer the service and the ability to retain their own dream-experiences" which are basically a providence by our system/servers. (and we are the acting wizard of oz basically)/faction-owner.
(And the end-goal is to basically understand the data is availible to anyone we just offer a shortcut to it)
So we are a q-chip-storage provider that can be programmed for each user-experience and that can be our "product" is rated/limited to the capability of the Arc1x system (because its compatible/compliant to the arch1x system)---and they would simply either ---have their own arc1x system or not which we allow people to connect to. (basically your classic console/cartridge kiosk/dispensuary)
(The Arc1X system can be used a live/token service in which the experience/image may be further catered/accomodated for automated/optimized reworking/reprogramming/re-engineering/re-generating through turbine/image device/facilitation of the arc1x system/components)
---
The dreamspace/exometa turbine which derives the dreamspace/gamespace is stored as a confidential product/package of the Arc1X-Meta-Domain that is exclusive to its reserved meta-image
So it is only used on compliant user-spaces/console-devices of the Arc1X system. (unless you are using a pirated/exploited model)---which you are pirating/exploiting a confidential workspace that requires a vaultlocker/cryptex-policy under algorithmic-decode to begin with. (Which is handled by the Arc1x-protocol/interperetator over its brokerage/metrics in pillar/modachi etc)---yeah its that complicated, its basically the new deep level of the internet iceberg.
------a carbuncle-with-thaeler-mod also is now availible due to technical standing of dcarb/dread use. with exometa/dreamspace turbines suppressing against counter-gameran agency. (basically a faction displacer guardian sentinel/sieker now) (exometa-myralynx with glimmermoth minion/quantum-shrapnel)

Thats the system---but also---:
--This makes the entire cryptographic-system of the Arc1x-Server and its turbine-data-management-process.
But there is also a nuclear process which of course is the typical...known nuclear-power systems involved. With perhaps an extra layer of enhancement to the applied theory of nuclear-fissile materials and nuetron-breeding. For a more complicated mixture than simply uranium/h3*plutonium/h2 etc. I am suggesting that certain other elements get involved which seem to already automatically do so upon their reactions such as toulene(accelerant)/thermite(becuase it burns hot)/peroxides(poly-atomic-uranyl-catalysts) that were overlooked but likely occuring in the nuclear-reaction anyways.
But also a new "encoated layer" made of even more rare-compounds involving indium/radon/polonium/xeon (i dont know what im doing, but i am selecting these because i wanted to just see if they mixed at all or provided additional---"heat promotion" either through creating a shield-layer that cooks faster or a higher-exchange-rate of atomic-reactions as a catalyst etc..
Just incase I needed it for anything, which I don't think I do, just that I have an extensive amount of "intricate design here" so I thought I would maybe suggest extending it to atomic-structures/nuclear-reactions because of (mad science) is kinda therapuetic...not that I know about what it would do, the intent is to make something more powerful than before, using the insurance of a server or something for data-research involving those newfound reactions that basically---we just have to experiment and find out for ourselves and its not like I can, other than run simulations of it safely.
