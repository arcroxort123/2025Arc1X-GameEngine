This will describe all the vocation and content for drones including their programming (when I get around to it.)
We can typically treat it in succession as the "working-progression" to building a town.

So we have:

Drafting-Drone
Plan-Certification-Drone
Development-Site-Drone
---
LandScaping (Terraformy-Setup) Drone
Hazard/Scaffold (Environment-Access) Drone
Demolition (Rock/Heavy Removal) Drone
Construction (Foundation-Base) Drone
---

Then we can get to vocations and sub-vocations
