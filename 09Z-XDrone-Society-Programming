09Z-XDrone-Society-Programming

This will describe all the vocation and content for drones including their programming (when I get around to it.)
We can typically treat it in succession as the "working-progression" to building a town.

So we have:

Drafting-Drone
Plan-Certification-Drone
Development-Site-Drone
---
LandScaping (Terraformy-Setup) Drone
Hazard/Scaffold (Environment-Access) Drone
Demolition (Rock/Heavy Removal) Drone
Construction (Foundation-Base) Drone
---

Then we can get to vocations and sub-vocations
This sets up the First Fairgrounds/Barebones Parse

This completes the GRAIL-chain.

Author's Note---The grail sets up daytime/nighttime also now.

Input for Exometa-Gameran which is the quivalent of a Corruption-Seed/Glitch-Mascot.
This thing likes to infest and make hives/lairs in nodespaces/gamespaces. It breaks rules.
It is the minion to the ward/warden of the terraform for which would basically be ---a magic-eye-system to the exometa spectrums/stratagems.
Which is canonized as a Golem/Guardian basically in control of mementia/tezera/mezera/exometa. So its going to corrupt/self-destruct and overall contaminate all exometa or other standard indexes.
And it will use DDAY/CRISIS with alpha-nukes.
So basically this is the last-boss.


There is also the exometa prosper which is a continuation of the builds being reinforced/fortified. This helps very little against any infiltrating/incursion based sovereignty such as an exometa-gameran, (which is the last boss).
And this is studied as a magic/meta leak of whqlr/xyple in blasty/xsqrly.
So we contain it in its own exometa-convention/vaultlocker and its the best we can do to keep it seperate from any of the faction/exometa images in support. Because it will counter algorithmic/corruptive as possible. (Basically its comparable to an overleveled/overpowered lastboss of an arena)

So the exometa-platitude with the f-reality / prosper/ grail becomes that arena.
And requires a succeessive campaign.
---So basically an Emerald-Castle situation using exometa peak/langs. And the succession prevents the dday/crisis (so thats fun).

Agentic-CryptoForm-Device-Manager: (Quantum-Table)
Protocols/Particle Exchange/Emission under Quantum Ordinance
QuantumCamera and Frame Rate (estimated 61,293 frames per second ---random number came to me in a dream) --(DarkZone/DeepMeta Cam-Box)
Use of decorate-filligree/quasi-lensing (sub-lensing for mass-storage)---Is this the glass-drive? Idk It might as well be to me, I dont but this is where to start with the components to examin/eval for it.
---QUANTUM REWRITABLE-DISK-DRIVE for META-IMAGE(virtualMachine) in QUANTUM-CODESTATE SUPPORTED-NODESPACE ---*(quantum dream achieved)
