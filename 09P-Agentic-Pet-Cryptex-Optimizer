09P-Agentic-Pet-Cryptex-Optimizer
This creates a mcp optimized META-server that incorporate/integrates/infrastructures/improves existing systems/services in a server-hosted-client to apply profiles/agentic-organization (botnet pipeline / encryption-management)
this handles meta-cryptex in all mcp bucket/cache
this uses several specialzied agents such as FETCH/FUSER/REWARD/LINKING and other co-ops.
I don't really need to explain a full prompt of commands and step taking, but generally it will ---create a mcp with automated prompts that will be used as service agents and they will colloborate in their priorities and other toolkits.
This is cool, its not like it isnt much different than a META-BRANE ITSELF, except that it literally takes ECO-QUOTIENTS/QUASI-LINT derived from metadata and centralized over the meta-domain, and the agents are basically the bees/drones or uap/lfo of the meta-brane. REALLY FUN
they are basically modachi-phoeboe or other orbitals, that have been SPECIALIZED. Really really fun.
(I dont care how controversial this is, I am having fun with this)
