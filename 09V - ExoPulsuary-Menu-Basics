This discusses the general user-experience/exopulsuary-menu-basic-preface and develops it for use as a trained-model): (it does not need to transcend/nuvolve any further) --it can still transmute/sync/relay/commit as needed:
This is broken into blocks/subblocks (chunks/subchunks) for OVERALL USER-FRIENDLY ACCESS (but can be customized anyway it can be imagined i guess)
BECAUSE of the 09U PREFACES this doesnt have to be this way, but it works with 09U PREFACES to setup itself this way. (I am aware of how convuluted it is, and this is the best way I can find any cohesion from the "winging it syndrome" that this entire thing is)
We use Custom-Blocks and Custom-SubBlocks that may work in co-dependency of each other or within their own background runtimes:
there isnt an overt order to it but...For instance the layouts look like 
Block-String # (priority) ---with wildcards to select/deselect within priority
SubBlockString # (priority) ---with wildcards to select/deselect priority (with subblocks generally being elective to the overall process/custom setups)
StringBuilds can also be prefaced per block in their comment so it looks like (basically esLINT-style)
Author's Note ---I am really freekin tired and dont want to think up subblocks right now but there would be like 5 or so for certain other blocks I can kinda imagine involving like (data-rates/meta-perks) for each block/custom to be preferenced/conditions to its user/profile --and I am just going to be lazy right now.
This may also include OVER-RIDES/RULE-SETS for DreamSpaces/Gamespaces.
As well as VoidSec/NullSec/Zerospace considerations.
