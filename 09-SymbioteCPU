09-SymbioteCPU

So to design a cpu(symbiote)
we use a current which is considered a load/hot-wire
the current is clocked with a pllc which is considered a loadout when it distributes this load/hotwire

-==pllc time
the pllc is triggered by the current passthrough which clocks a direct current to an on/off repeater

-==socket time
this is comptracted to the socket
the socket has then a power circuit that channels what active power is sent to a cache storage
the other socket has a circuit to an insulator in case of overcharge it will insulate
the other socket alternate has a route to a resistor which will close the socket in case of overcharge
these sockets are triggered when insulation is charged with an overcharge that the resistor kicks the connection

===cpu time
and the power channel is also fed the charge to a storage which also somewhat simulates as an insulator when it is overcharged
so this is the entrypoint of the cpu, which is channeled by the pllcx, to the socket, to the comptracted power circuit
---
so after the entrypoint has received power it transfers to the architecture of the cpu
and the next diodes upon the gpu are used as a binary readout for i/o (on/off) in such a fashion as to simulate the pathway
these pathways may also have a cache offload
---
the first pathways consist of a range of binary diodes sequenced such as to simulate the first signals of a cpu
these then branch off in a consistent pattern to the advancements of those sequences being arranged in other pathways
that the advanced pathways have notarized a microscopic/atomic blend of signal/cache which are then coordinated to the
organized ram-chain of the cpu architecture onboard the cpu chip--as the beginning stages of a compute.
---
this is pipelined to a bucket of prioritized ram-chains/memetic-address which is stored in more diodes expressed under a cpu partition in the architecture which may be invoked/called through initial selections in the following compute(so we have entrypoint/pathway/ramchain/collectivebucket/compute-initials)
---
these set up the pipeline for pllc-->compute using a conjunction under pllc--socket--entrypoint of a cpu connection
this connection is then bootloaded under a diagnostic binary which advances itself to hexadecimal imprinting under its loadout/offloads which are considered a payload in the cpu architecture. (post-commit) to function-print
---
these then allow for a consistent sequence of pipeline event-chains to be analysed as a fully expressed Compute of Binary/Hexadecimal Logic-Basis. *(Logistic-Data)
----
This data is then coordinated under its title/assign in a checksum/voucher bulletin/traffic stack to coordinate under handle/PID as service/journal instances for which have been addressed.
----
these remain in schedule until reorganized for distribution under packet-protocols to the CPU-ENCODE
----
this may or may not be encrypted upon release of the stack. upon which they are sent to RAM(exchange) (usually for write to target periphereal etc hard-drive cache).
----
the results are tracked and sent back and forth until succession of terms/policies have been considered and then are set to a transfer-connection.
