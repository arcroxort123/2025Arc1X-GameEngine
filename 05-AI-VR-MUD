SOME "thing" I designed to help illustrate what it takes to run a SERVER2CLIENT-hosting VRSYSTEM(VR-MUD)
As of right now its just some HYPE from an old file I had lying around.
THIS WOULD BE USED VIA A DATABASE-INTERCEPTOR such as Zabbix/BURP or something...to actively monitor a gamespace (as its used)
This will track USERS through a VRMUD (while the GameSpace is loaded it attempts to track the users seperately from the instance) via Exoscopy/Viewporting the DOMAIN-data-trails.
To be honest--i dont know what i was thinking and this is a madscience grab that the ai will figure it out for me.

BASICALLY it starts out as a SENSITIVE-DATA-SIGNAL which is quickly overwritten/over-run by other priority codes (so it just tries to latch on to what it can)
1:It attempts to diagnostic interface or grubwork  --(QUICKMODEL)
2:Creates a Profile/Journal (Operating/Subsystem)  --(QUICKFRAME)
3:Creates a Window/Workspace --(QUICKSHELL)
4:Begins program-ready changeouts using botfeeds/tas user tracking (Interceptions) --(QUICK-FILL) --(stream)
5:Attempts Security/Administrations and Interaction/Interferences/Infiltrations/Inferences etc --(QUICK-POP) --(buffer)
Once this is achieved it has establish a NONSENSITIVE DATA-STREAM as a VRMUD ADAPTIVE-CLIENT INTERFACE/SHELL which is interacting with its environment to provide a steady stream of data)

Its called a VRMUD because it attempts to match to a client-feed/loop (when it obviously is spoofing definitions until it does)
This can later be advanced with interpretators/negotations/handshakes/encrpytions/encodes/languages over a databank/database. And then once its correctly set it can reapplied to a working-gamespace or field-test.
In recreational This allows A VRMUD to quickly simulate a target environment and attempt to integrate commands or exchange data between isolated instances or directly if allowed/elevated within accessibility.
In weaponized terms it may be forced/heavy strategic-commands that seek to take priority over other users/varaibles etc.
---If a gamespace is targeted it will attempt to "crackshot/oneshot" certain pipelines/bypass to achieve connection (As default)
---In a warzone it will do the same regardless of collatoral or reports. (Because it doesnt need to care about defcon/severity)
---IN a psyops it tries to do this stealtfully and assert/aquire data/claims etc upon infosec/aquisition of its target index/assets ETC)---its just trying to takeover/takedown data either peacibly/combatively. Depending on how the VRMUD may respond or not. Or depending on how a REMOTE/VECTOR GAMESPACE/TARGET RESPONDS.
---In extreme cases it will adapt/alter its data/transmits. Or backtrack VARIABLES in a strategic fashion. (IT IS JUST An AI-VR MUD PROGRAM if it works it works, if it doesn't it was worth a shot I guess)
