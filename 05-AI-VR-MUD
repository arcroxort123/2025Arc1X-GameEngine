SOME "thing" I designed to help illustrate what it takes to run a SERVER2CLIENT-hosting VRSYSTEM(VR-MUD)
As of right now its just some HYPE from an old file I had lying around.
THIS WOULD BE USED VIA A DATABASE-INTERCEPTOR such as Zabbix/BURP or something...to actively monitor a gamespace (as its used)
This will track USERS through a VRMUD (while the GameSpace is loaded it attempts to track the users seperately from the instance) via Exoscopy/Viewporting the DOMAIN-data-trails.
To be honest--i dont know what i was thinking and this is a madscience grab that the ai will figure it out for me.

BASICALLY it starts out as a SENSITIVE-DATA-SIGNAL which is quickly overwritten/over-run by other priority codes (so it just tries to latch on to what it can)
1:It attempts to diagnostic interface or grubwork  --(QUICKMODEL)
2:Creates a Profile/Journal (Operating/Subsystem)  --(QUICKFRAME)
3:Creates a Window/Workspace --(QUICKSHELL)
4:Begins program-ready changeouts using botfeeds/tas user tracking (Interceptions) --(QUICK-FILL) --(stream)
5:Attempts Security/Administrations and Interaction/Interferences/Infiltrations/Inferences etc --(QUICK-POP) --(buffer)
Once this is achieved it has establish a NONSENSITIVE DATA-STREAM as a VRMUD ADAPTIVE-CLIENT INTERFACE/SHELL which is interacting with its environment to provide a steady stream of data)

Its called a VRMUD because it attempts to match to a client-feed/loop (when it obviously is spoofing definitions until it does)
This can later be advanced with interpretators/negotations/handshakes/encrpytions/encodes/languages over a databank/database. And then once its correctly set it can reapplied to a working-gamespace or field-test.
In recreational This allows A VRMUD to quickly simulate a target environment and attempt to integrate commands or exchange data between isolated instances or directly if allowed/elevated within accessibility.
In weaponized terms it may be forced/heavy strategic-commands that seek to take priority over other users/varaibles etc.
---If a gamespace is targeted it will attempt to "crackshot/oneshot" certain pipelines/bypass to achieve connection (As default)
---In a warzone it will do the same regardless of collatoral or reports. (Because it doesnt need to care about defcon/severity)
---IN a psyops it tries to do this stealtfully and assert/aquire data/claims etc upon infosec/aquisition of its target index/assets ETC)---its just trying to takeover/takedown data either peacibly/combatively. Depending on how the VRMUD may respond or not. Or depending on how a REMOTE/VECTOR GAMESPACE/TARGET RESPONDS.
---In extreme cases it will adapt/alter its data/transmits. Or backtrack VARIABLES in a strategic fashion. (IT IS JUST An AI-VR MUD PROGRAM if it works it works, if it doesn't it was worth a shot I guess) --the goal being it will set up for ACTIVE-MONITORING of any assets of its target in an EZ-ID or HOTFIX to any changes made within its target as it has been prepared to adjust discreetly per databank involved/iterated.
IT IS A SPYKIT, if anything, designed to TINKER with other programs.
Once installed, it can attempt performances and actor-usage through METRIC-ANALYSIS etc. (This may also result in some BUGGY-CHARACTERS) much like EDWARD's-COMPUTER FROM COWBOYBEBOP or KIRITO in SWORDARTONLINE (I DONT KNOW or silly things like that).

This ALSO allows for CLONE-BUILDING/GAME-SPOOFING which is basically like "not even important" or at all a big deal to anyone. But allows MODS basically to be AUTO-GENERATED/AUTO-PROMPTED and used in a cool way if it ever worked in Concept. (PRO TIP IM NOT A CODER LOL)
So its really just an advanced MOD-MAKING-PROGRAM/AD-RIPPING-MACHINE when you think about it. And I personally think its cute because (I also orphaned this idea and just rediscovered it) 
Here it is:

NOW WE BEGIN GUI-HUD DESIGN/CUSTOM SETTINGS which are integrated and default to a TERMINAL/OUTPUT-SCREEN.
So the screen may have its "own game-overlay" etc. Which is great.

Part 3
DEVGEAR ECHOBOX
Since fuel empowerments are already availible so this tends to use crystallization/reformative custom/frameworks. (suppression/quarantine of cyber-psychosis)
Refinment Injection is a DEV-GEAR Process-GRANT that auto-refines a commodity with whatever resources are availible (energy)
