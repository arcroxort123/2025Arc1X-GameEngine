This part Compares to FACTIONbased MAFIA/PIRATE/ROGUE/RIVAL SAFETY-PROTOCOL etc (and is used in confidentiality to other system processes unless authorized/allowed/afforded/elevated through permissions/authetication etc)

This continues from the EXOTEMPLATE autotransmutes
which carry over for the XRECOMPILER
This is an extension of the ExotTEMPLATE to formulate under live/sync/buffer/direct.

This formulates its own telemetry within the GameSpace (similar to a NAS-Cluster operation)

Interactive GameWorld RUNTIME 
Stage1:
EntryLEVEL/Implant(Return)
--
WORLD VIEW|CAMERA
USER PIPE|LINE ASSETS
--
Subtract/Contiguity:
SERVICE|PROCESS

Stage2: CALL/PICK (*SUM/INVOKE)
XSURGE/XSCOPY is to current/next CYCLE
Entry Container: SWITCH-TO
LOOP<->FEED (vice/versa)
Vault:PANIC-GLOB
(CRYPTEX) set to Object/Surface Vector/FACE (Normal/VERTEX) --cloth/polyfabric  (XGFX/RENDER)
Then Yield POINT-DELTA (survey) of Sequence Step/Cycle.
SCRIPT:MAKE:PRINT

So it basically does Stage1 and then Stage2 as the RUNTIME
Establishing NUSHA SECURE-BLACKSITE-LOCKDOWN Clearence/Transfer/Exchange/Authorization of Game-Assets.

This also forms under Chronicle/Crude-Codes which can be counted as uptick/downswells.
