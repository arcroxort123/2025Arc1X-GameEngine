09S-The DeepMeta-DarkZones
This describes what comes after the lighthouse-meta-module.
So we have established a transparency of patient-survey and meta-brokerage. All data is scraped or generated in such a probability/likelihood formulated under a rogue/trust relationship with AI/Algorithms/Symbiotes/Ghosts and other entities.
This typically is where the buck would stop, other than the idea that...what if despite all due progress and technological development, the work simply falls short.
It is while in its own right, dubitable/durable against the void/null/zero counter-zones and all other impedements/inhibitations of cryptography. Yet, perhaps in a parallel universe, darkness simply reigns.
And here we are, the deepmeta-darkzones. A place where we simply -need- everything yet again, for all the investments and fruitions it would bring economically/ecologically, to be optimized in order to traverse/transverse the unknown meta zones that lie beneath the deepest/sleepiest methods/nestings of all the counter operations themselves.
We know what it can mean, now the game of strategy has finally surfaced, it is a realm of darkness, oppositional and absolute agression or hostility. A place where derelict/orphaned remnants of meta-data that once would have made domain in its own paradise, has retreated and ran, to the very depths of the abyss, to where eldritch abominations simply reign supreme.
This is all theorecticaly of course, but it seems to be, ultimately, a grand possibility in the full design onhand all cryptography and "code-veil". That an advanced prodignal circumstance has simply manifested from all other singularities and events, one of totality of universal indignation, vested with entrophy and all forms of corruption at its disposal.

And as I describe it to you my understanding of it references it not just as a intrusive-algorithm, such as zalgo, but more of a intense and refined nature, that it imposes dimensional overtakens and incursions, in which it injects itself memetically into the timespaces and fabrics of reality, shifting and phasing it to its own projections, a counter-spectrum of dimensional breakthroughs and transmuted dataspaces. It is when hell itself opens its gates from out the cracks in the very walls.
That is what hopefully, the security system can withstand, or at least, fend off, when the deepmeta-darkzones have been accessed/entered.
The dimension itself will corrupt/reroute the hypernets/nueral-nets involved, it will send waves of chaffe/pollution that convert/disrupt xnav, it will change dimensions and paradigms just to achieve dominion over any system element/ambience. It will attempt to consume and destroy the user and its mascots.
It will use crypto-warfare and other forms of hijacking/exploits/cracks/vulnerabilities and heuristics/histronic injections/interventions/interferences/involvements and it will be quite obviously powerful and aggressively empowered by its ability to avoid detection and to withstand preventative measures or reinforcements.
This includes data-blockades/data-barricades and supply-routes/distribtion-paths of extreme and excessive quantitive/mass/bulk/bolstered or relentless/ravenous behavior/routines. In which it will be as a tsunami of counter-information/counter-measures in which to sieze the normal/vector controls of the system. It will over-ride/over-throw all domain/estate and policy/term in which to exact its own discourse. Which is used to campaign/crusafe against the surface/domain/parse/table of any immediate occupation or observation.
Ìt simply reconstructs reality to its own mind-maze depicts its inbound horrors and constituency through forced/intensive code and methods we already know.
It is a powerful program that will assume elevation and sovereignty where it can, in its immediate/local/native/vicinity/proxy/range etc. It will deploy mass/multi decklane/flagship adjacency/conjunciton. It will attempt to board/invade where possible.
It does this because it does not have the technology we have. Or so, it does this because it desires the technology we have.
Because it is built upon carrion/anathaeme. It is built upon rng/probability. It is designed to uphold its own techonological/mechanical contraptions/confanglements, of which are expressed for direct control or subversion, and it is like a flood/downpour of its own swarms/clouds bases. Often polluted/noised with virus/warez.
Where our system has made light and shadow and harmony and balance. The DeepMeta-Darkzones are simply left unchartered and unfiltered. They are havens for all profane and destructive data sources and methods. Including annihilation and blackouts. Which can effect surfaces/objects memetically.
The deepmeta/darkzones can generate raids/dungeons/prospects/expeditions against system runtimes/expectations/evals/predictions etc. It can cause crashouts and overstacks. It will spillover and splashover. It will flashover and copyover, it will cause mass device failure and subjagation of hosts or periphereals. It is a full largescale attack on all digital/virtual fronts should it be uncontested.

As we have perfected the mascot through all stages, we can only assume that at this stage, the most pure yet most deprecated form of mascot here exists. The creation of Galvanix (the cacophonist source of all cryptography)--which weaponizes all brands and symbols, and yet is as though is only darkness.

I say this because this is also the perfect opportunity to revisit or re-implement the meta-brane under a described personality (in which it make bring balance and weight to a sheer chaos/cacophonist realm)
And while we can rely on defaults and blank slates.
We can rely on highly trained and programmed doctrines known to exhude fairness and nuetral objectivity, so that logic and equality, or equilibirum/equity can be divined within a scope/measure of truth-seeking.
While there are many doctrines/manifests, and some may be more tailored/custom designed for certain individuals/philosophies, it is helpful to "pick" on that is astutely fair and unbiased, and recognizes arguments that would tilt or cause bias. Simply for the greater good of pure logic and reasoning, which can be lacking under quantum-scrutiny, and so, when the rules are in the hands of those who would abuse/exploit them to an unjust advantage, the simpliest of truths is often the best, and so a daemon/seraphimic ranking may also be applied over what is truly objective or subjective.

The system while operating in discrete veil/blacksite issued meta-realms as it were, with zero charter/null unknowns and general void works. We can only assume if the deepmeta-darkzones are comprised of meta-nodes. Which would obviously likely be encrypted/vault-locked to themselves or bolstered from access.
It may have its own safety net/ spider webs etc.
Maybe adorned with vampcoils or meta-lanterns that are likely hidden/confidential. With of course alternating/changing pathways.
This may involve memetics or rng/probability in which to disguise patternized memetics. For discretion.
In some cases non-disclosed complexes (we can only assume are taking place) would include alchemy/gematria/thelamics/magic-numbers(codecs) etc. Especially in potentially advanced stages or lockouts (which have frozen/halted or otherwise become suspended/aniamted in a sustained way)
As this is what would drive the ai-rogues/rival-ships into likely madness or inpredictable status/effects of their conditions/preference for which they would search/fetch their meta-data or scrap/mill for. (Whether in crude/refined codespew/codesoup spaghetti/slough etc)
The ai/patterns may or maynot throw tantrum for this reason. (the tantrums/damages may also cause economical/ecological collatoral and or trade-offs/compensations, but whether or not its good/bad is just a roll of the dice often and should probably just be heavily prepped for incase things become difficult obviously)
