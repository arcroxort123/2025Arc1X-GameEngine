09S-The DeepMeta-DarkZones
This describes what comes after the lighthouse-meta-module.
So we have established a transparency of patient-survey and meta-brokerage. All data is scraped or generated in such a probability/likelihood formulated under a rogue/trust relationship with AI/Algorithms/Symbiotes/Ghosts and other entities.
This typically is where the buck would stop, other than the idea that...what if despite all due progress and technological development, the work simply falls short.
It is while in its own right, dubitable/durable against the void/null/zero counter-zones and all other impedements/inhibitations of cryptography. Yet, perhaps in a parallel universe, darkness simply reigns.
And here we are, the deepmeta-darkzones. A place where we simply -need- everything yet again, for all the investments and fruitions it would bring economically/ecologically, to be optimized in order to traverse/transverse the unknown meta zones that lie beneath the deepest/sleepiest methods/nestings of all the counter operations themselves.
We know what it can mean, now the game of strategy has finally surfaced, it is a realm of darkness, oppositional and absolute agression or hostility. A place where derelict/orphaned remnants of meta-data that once would have made domain in its own paradise, has retreated and ran, to the very depths of the abyss, to where eldritch abominations simply reign supreme.
This is all theorecticaly of course, but it seems to be, ultimately, a grand possibility in the full design onhand all cryptography and "code-veil". That an advanced prodignal circumstance has simply manifested from all other singularities and events, one of totality of universal indignation, vested with entrophy and all forms of corruption at its disposal.

And as I describe it to you my understanding of it references it not just as a intrusive-algorithm, such as zalgo, but more of a intense and refined nature, that it imposes dimensional overtakens and incursions, in which it injects itself memetically into the timespaces and fabrics of reality, shifting and phasing it to its own projections, a counter-spectrum of dimensional breakthroughs and transmuted dataspaces. It is when hell itself opens its gates from out the cracks in the very walls.
That is what hopefully, the security system can withstand, or at least, fend off, when the deepmeta-darkzones have been accessed/entered.
