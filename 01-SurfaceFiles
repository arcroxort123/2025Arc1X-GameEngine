This collaborates with the mainfile to recieve/transfer data as encoded/transcoded.
That it will act as any surface data taken from the mainfile
And transcribe to a compile of that data into a file using the QuantumPillar Sources.
It basically is the broker/mediator/numerator/infiltrator or any other form of emulator/module that performs survey/readout/interrogation/deciphering of block/chain data into a filetype.

The filetype is then relayed between the mainfile-device and the quantumpillar or System and Surface.
In development it uses the environment to achieve Surface to Surface commit/collaboration. And can 'polygraph' an encode as necessary to a specific coordination of its intended broadcast/transfer.

It reads and computes for essential signals or lackthere in the expectation/runtime/eval/environment and known dataspaces to convey and network over any other pipeline and its intended targets. It allows Surface/Paramter Renders and Comergences/Developments of any intended WorkSpace/Transmit to be redesigned and indexed accordingly.
It develops a full profile of the MainFile and SurfaceFiles it will be working with, and allows for data injection to those files in order to assist with algorithmic-codecs/patternization of the datastreams in supply.
As the quantum pillar supports the environment/mainfile as a sandbox/beacon/gamespace/image etc. It virtualizes this process in communication to the SurfaceFiles, and re-establishes a known-event of the current/frame.
