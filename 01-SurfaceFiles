This collaborates with the mainfile to recieve/transfer data as encoded/transcoded.
That it will act as any surface data taken from the mainfile
And transcribe to a compile of that data into a file using the QuantumPillar Sources.
It basically is the broker/mediator/numerator/infiltrator or any other form of emulator/module that performs survey/readout/interrogation/deciphering of block/chain data into a filetype.

The filetype is then relayed between the mainfile-device and the quantumpillar or System and Surface.
In development it uses the environment to achieve Surface to Surface commit/collaboration. And can 'polygraph' an encode as necessary to a specific coordination of its intended broadcast/transfer.

It reads and computes for essential signals or lackthere in the expectation/runtime/eval/environment and known dataspaces to convey and network over any other pipeline and its intended targets. It allows Surface/Paramter Renders and Comergences/Developments of any intended WorkSpace/Transmit to be redesigned and indexed accordingly.
It develops a full profile of the MainFile and SurfaceFiles it will be working with, and allows for data injection to those files in order to assist with algorithmic-codecs/patternization of the datastreams in supply.
As the quantum pillar supports the environment/mainfile as a sandbox/beacon/gamespace/image etc. It virtualizes this process in communication to the SurfaceFiles, and re-establishes a known-event of the current/frame or auto-buffers/auto-streams to the intended holography/virtualized substrata/stratagem. (and local/natives and ambient/meta/elements/objects etc) in utility of the known-event/surface-files.
Now that there is powered environment and internal network to achieve signal transmission it allows broadcast-routing to be pipelined to known assets and properties of those SurfaceFiles in conjunction to compliance with the mainfile. And the environment begins to auto-generate/pro-generate as is propogated per Profile overall of the Realm-Policies.
--this is also supported by toolkits/rootkits forensics/utensils in data-management/rescue/security/utility etc.
This can also form hotfix/quickfix/slapfix/patchups as needed and allows for SkunkWorks And Timesyncs.
In complex usages, that can be deployed to assist with power-algorithms and codespells. (Choreagraphy)
This is also useful as a blackmarket-exchanger for auto-product-allocation to holography-staging of the environment/user-experiece involved of the workspace. That the "BlackMarket" can takeover/bypass several factors of the GameSpace in order to facilitate its own profile/refactor of the focality/paradigm involved in any vector/sector of partition/allocation.
This is referred to as RuneGating.
The RuneGates are locked to a specified entry of the image/instance and user/experience involved. And are coordinated to matchbase and signature of policy/entitlements of the image/user/environment/network and the blackmarket-capacity itself including Rulesets/Behaviors and Definition/Preference/Condition/Property/Variable for which its selection pertains/consists in runtime/cycle of the overall status/state/stat/echo Chamber/Layer/Node/Vector/Stack Case/Depth/Frame/Screen or any other extension/adapter thereof the beacon/conduit/sandbox/engine etc.
Locks correspond to Mainfile Encodes (which may be temporarily bricked if over-charged or ddos'd for any reason to prevent spillout/dataleaks and potential corruption) --this may be timeout to further secure stability/turbulence and handles/checksums with Identifiers/PageFiles. --yay4that
It will also handle package callbacks/refunds or anything like a package-failure/connection-failure to the Surface/SurfaceFiles Involved with the assistance of the Environment/Pillar (Lab/Expo Assisted-Caretaking) and this includes promisuary/edificiary/versionary/(archivals)/compressions/known-trusted-indexes and any other form of retentive/memetic-yield/input-data that is channeled/streamed in the consistancy/overflow once it becomes "Manageable by Controller or SubPosts/PostPOnes/outposts/Zonings/Cluster"
---
This may be scheduled as necessary to avoid conflicts/hangups and other potential stalls/blocklists.

The idea is that it(any data in midstream or in cycle) is Profiled for Express use. (As is MOST Protocols/Processing of the systems data-transfers) and this will catch-any-errors if detected/discovered/alerted/tested.
Upon successful integration/refinement of the Surface/Data involved it will provide its own Hash/SymLink to further adjust as scheduled in its provider/project and then is validated/confirmed for entry/print.
For EaseOfUse/QualityOfLife/Accesibility and such---the information may be auto-profiled to its own whql etc. And its own visa/wpad will be tracked so that it can be re-correalated/remote-accessed for verification/agreement to any other additional handshake/negotiation/connection/matchbase involved.
